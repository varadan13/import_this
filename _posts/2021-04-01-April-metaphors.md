"One lesson from affiliating a tree is that same lesson of inherency, of what is, without the least regard to what the looker on (the critic) supposes or says, or whether he likes or dislikes"   
> Walt Whitman  

Oh, the passenger   
How, how he rides    
Oh, the passenger     
He rides and he rides    
He looks through his window     
What does he see?    
He sees the silent hollow sky    
He sees the stars come out tonight     
He sees the city's ripped backsides     
He sees the winding ocean drive         
And everything was made for you and me      
All of it was made for you and me        
'Cause it just belongs to you and me     
So let's take a ride and see what's mine

"Someone has a great fire in his soul and nobody ever comes to warm themselves at it, and passers-by see nothing but a little smoke at the top of the chimney"
