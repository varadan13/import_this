title: Why do I not care about exponential increase?
---

During the intial days of the Wuhan pandemic some folks were talking about exponential increase of positive cases but for a random individual when they go out they would think like,"Hey, I am fine. Nothing has happened to me nor to the folks in my immediate surrounding why should I care about exponential increase." Fair point I should say because here their safety is cemented down by their confirmation bias. 

Why is exponential increase not intutively felt by a random individual? I think because exponential increase first affects the society and then indirectly effects an individual when: hospitals are no longer able to function in usual capacity, supply chain disruption etc.
