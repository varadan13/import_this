# Archive of Metaphors and thoughts, March 2021

I love metaphors and surreal thoughts because I believe they are like mathematics highly capable of telling so many things in a sentence or two. I will maintain this archive as long as I find time to read some of my favourite authors and poets. 

## From Poems

"Tell me, is the rose naked  
or is that her only dress?"  

"How many churches are there in heaven?"   

"Why do leaves commit suicide  
when they feel yellow?"  

"How many questions does a cat have?"   

"What will they say about my poetry  
who never touched my blood?"  

"And who asked spring time  
for its kingdom of clear air?" 

"Why do all silkworms live so raggedly?"

\->[Pablo Nerudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Neruda), Book of Questions   

## From Prose

"The  designs of the universe are  unknown to  us, but we  do know that to think with lucidity and to  act with fairness is to aid those de­signs  (which shall never be revealed to us)."   

\->[Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges), [A Prayer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17720.In_Praise_of_Darkness).
