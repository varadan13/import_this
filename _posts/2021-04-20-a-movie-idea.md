"Everyone is talking and nobody wants to listen cause its boring" How can I show this graphically? What stories can I tell using this point of view? I want to make a movie using this point of view. The movie must be a social character study. 

NO CRITICISM NO CONCLUSION BUT JUST REPORT THE EVENTS AS IS. 

Must show the role of instant gratification in my society.

Big Hash Tags for example "#purge hate" I want to show the epicness of these movement and yet again why they don't make a difference. I want to show individuals making it partly out of good nature and partly because of instant gratification and to get the fame they desire. A society that is created solely by literally considering problems that matters as a mere stepping stone to ones success. "WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT EXIST BY NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEMS"

I want to show how quick solutions are encouraged and actual solutions reach deaf ears and that these quick solutions are mere sultry propositions to easily throw away the problems.


How can the society that treats problems as stepping stones to ones success exist without solve some problems?

For example politicians. let's say they pick up the problem of global warming. they first try to do epic scale video conferences, talks, hash tag movements. And simultaneously suggests a solution. and it is easy for them to suggest solution. all they do is google 'Politically and scientifically accurate solutions to a problem X' and then yap about till they get elected or reelected and then they forget about it. Are there any alternatives.well no. I don't think so. But it is always good to know the reality isn't it?

I have meet many people who can find solutions but very rarely do I meet anybody who can successfully execute it.

Events that inspired me.

What did they achieve?

12 minutes of fame. did they change hate? was it difficult to do what they did? will they sacrifice their life for this cause. I bet they are doing their high profile assignments now and enjoying massive internet traffic in their social media profiles which make them believe that they are activists agents of change or what ever! I see them having caused no change what so ever to the problem that they were dancing for. it is just another stepping stone to their success
