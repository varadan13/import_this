            "content": "Data model as a description of Python as a framework. It formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, iterators, functions, classes, context managers and so on. | The special method names allows objects to implement, support and interact with basic language constructs such as: iteration, collections, attribute access, operator overloading, function and method invocation, string representation and formating, manage contexts. | . Two advantages of using special methods . the users of user defined class don&#39;t have to memorize method names for standard operations(&quot;How to get the number of items?, etc&quot;) | It&#39;s easier to benefit from the rich Python standard library and avoid reinventing the wheel like the random.choice function. | . Note . Just by implementing the $__getitem__$ special method, the class also becomes iterable.(why?) | . Why len is not a method? . len is not called as a method because it gets special treatment as part of the Python Data Model, just like abs. But thanks to the special method $__len__$ you can also make len work with your own custom objects | Think of len and abs as unary operators. | . namedtuple &#8212; Tuple Subclass with Named Fields . Each kind of namedtuple is represented by its own class, which is created by using the namedtuple() factory function. .

Must show the role of instant gratification in my society. . Big Hash Tags for example “#purge hate” I want to show the epicness of these movement and yet again why they don’t make a difference. I want to show individuals making it partly out of good nature and partly because of instant gratification and to get the fame they desire. A society that is created solely by literally considering problems that matters as a mere stepping stone to ones success. “WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT EXIST BY NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEMS” . I want to show how quick solutions are encouraged and actual solutions reach deaf ears and that these quick solutions are mere sultry propositions to easily throw away the problems. . How can the society that treats problems as stepping stones to ones success exist without solve some problems? . For example politicians. let’s say they pick up the problem of global warming. they first try to do epic scale video conferences, talks, hash tag movements. And simultaneously suggests a solution. and it is easy for them to suggest solution. all they do is google ‘Politically and scientifically accurate solutions to a problem X’ and then yap about till they get elected or reelected and then they forget about it. Are there any alternatives.well no. I don’t think so. But it is always good to know the reality isn’t it? . I have meet many people who can find solutions but very rarely do I meet anybody who can successfully execute it. . Events that inspired me. . What did they achieve? . 12 minutes of fame. did they change hate? was it difficult to do what they did? will they sacrifice their life for this cause. I bet they are doing their high profile assignments now and enjoying massive internet traffic in their social media profiles which make them believe that they are activists agents of change or what ever! I see them having caused no change what so ever to the problem that they were dancing for. it is just another stepping stone to their success .",

            "content": "On hashable objects . An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a hash() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an__eq__() method). . | Python Glossary states: “All of Python’s immutable built-in objects are hashable” but that is inaccurate because a tuple is immutable, yet it may contain references to unhashable objects. . | If you implement a class with a custom eq method then you must also implement a suitable hash, because you must always make sure that if a == b is True then hash(a) == hash(b) is also True. Otherwise you are breaking an invariant of the hash table algorithm, with the grave consequence that dicts and sets will not deal reliably with your objects. If a custom eq depends on mutable state, then hash must raise TypeError with a message like unhashable type: ‘MyClass’. . | . On how python mapping objects deals with missing values . Underlying method used to deal with missing keys is the aptly named missing method. This method is not defined in the base dict class, but dict is aware of it: if you subclass dict and provide a missing method, the standard dict.getitem will call it whenever a key is not found, instead of raising KeyError. . | The missing method is just called by getitem, i.e. for the d[k] operator. The presence of a missing method has no effect on the behavior of other methods that look up keys, such as get or contains (which implements the in operator). . | . On update method of dict . The way update handles its first argument m is a prime example of duck typing: it first checks whether m has a keys method and, if it does, assumes it is a mapping. Otherwise, update falls back to iterating over m, assuming its items are (key, value) pairs. | . Practical consequences of how dict works . Keys must be hashable objects . | dicts have significant memory overhead . | Key search is very fast . | Key ordering depends on insertion order . | Adding items to a dict may change the order of existing keys . | . Practical consequences of how set works . Set elements must be hashable objects. . | Sets have a significant memory overhead. . | Membership testing is very efficient. . | Element ordering depends on insertion order. . | Adding elements to a set may change the order of other elements. . | . On null set construction . Syntax quirk Don’t forget: to create an empty set, use the constructor without an argument: set(). If you write {}, you’re creating an empty dict — this hasn’t changed | .",

Let $X_1$ be an explanatory variable. Let&#39;s suppose $X_1$ ~ $exp( lambda = 1)$ Let&#39;s use numpy and draw 15 random observation from the above distribution and assign the variable X1 to it. . X1 = np.random.exponential(size=15) . Let $X_2$ like $X_1$ be another explanatory variable which follows exponential distribution with mean = 1. Let&#39;s use numpy to create random vector X2 of size 15 from the required distribution . X2 = np.random.exponential(size=15) . We know that the error is assumed to follow the standard normal distribution so let&#39;s use numpy to generate a random error vector of size 15 from the standard normal distribtuion . error=np.random.normal(size=15) # by default numpy&#39;s normal function # outputs standard normal variates . Let Y be a dependent variable that is generated from X1,X2 and error. Let&#39;s suppose Y is generated as follows: $Y=1.11+123X_1+45X_2+error$ Therefore the linear model we are considering is $Y= beta_0+ beta_1X_1+ beta_2X_2+error$ with $ beta_0=1.11, beta_1=123, beta_2=45$ Let&#39;s interpret beta1 and beta2 . Y=1.11+123*X1+45*X2+error . To interpret $ beta_1$. First, Let&#39;s regress Y with $X_2$ . reg =udregression(X2,Y).fit_model() # don&#39;t worry about udregression # it is a custom class I wrote # and for the code click the below link. . Link to udregreesison&#39;s source code . Let&#39;s now find the residuals of this regression . residual= Y -reg.fittedvalues residual . array([ -9.91016593, -94.00822722, -5.7247282 , 65.59993044, 42.23952437, 14.23110086, 36.70187822, -82.68784607, -67.94269339, -105.34239585, -17.82715355, 4.53419721, -106.44550192, 38.80625987, 287.77582115]) . Let&#39;s now regress the residuals with X1 and inspect the obtained parameter . reg =udregression(X1,residual).fit_model() slope = reg.params[1] slope . 122.63790390315614 . We can see that the slope is closer to $ beta_1$ and if the observation is large we can check that it will be equal to $ beta_1$. Notice that we obtained $ beta_1$ as slope coefficient while regressing X1 with the residual of the regression of X2 and Y. . Here Residuals act as a measure of the variance of Y that has not been captured by X2. . Regression(residual,$X_1$) is attempting to explain the variance of Y that has not been explained by $X_2$. . From single variable regression the slope parameter has the following interpretation: slope parameter measures the change in Y or dependent variable due to an unit change in the independent variable. . Therefore, $ beta_1$ measures the change in residual due to an unit change in $X_1$. Let&#39;s apply the definition of residual on the preceding sentence and rewrite it. $ beta_1$ measures the change in Y from an unit change in $X_1$ after removing the influence of $X_2$ on Y. . Let&#39;s define $ beta_2$ using $ beta_1$&#39;s definition as a template. . $ beta_2$ measures the change in Y from an unit change in $X_2$ after removing the influence of $X_1$ on Y. . Let&#39;s check if it is indeed true. . To interpret $ beta_2$ . regressing Y with $X_1$ . reg =udregression(X1,Y).fit_model() . finding the residual . residual = Y - reg.fittedvalues . regressing residual with X2 and finding the slope . reg =udregression(X2,residual).fit_model() slope=reg.params[1] slope . 45.28046614638129 . We can see that the slope is indeed equal to $ beta_2$ . These interpretations are however valid as long as the underlying assumptions are approximately valid . For example let&#39;s do the following . X2=0.99*X1 Y=1.11+123*X1+45*X2+error # we have created a strongly correlated X1 and X2 . reg =udregression(X1,Y).fit_model() residue = Y - reg.fittedvalues reg =udregression(X2,residue).fit_model() slope=reg.params[1] slope . 1.6479439340910673e-14 . We can see that the above slope not equal to $ beta_2$ and therefore we cannot use the interpretation of $ beta_2$ we have learnt here. . Conclusion . $ beta_1$ measures the change in Y from an unit change in $X_1$ after removing the influence of $X_2$ on Y. | $ beta_2$ measures the change in Y from an unit change in $X_2$ after removing the influence of $X_1$ on Y. | .",
