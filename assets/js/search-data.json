            "content": "Data model as a description of Python as a framework. It formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, iterators, functions, classes, context managers and so on. | The special method names allows objects to implement, support and interact with basic language constructs such as: iteration, collections, attribute access, operator overloading, function and method invocation, string representation and formating, manage contexts. | . Two advantages of using special methods . the users of user defined class don&#39;t have to memorize method names for standard operations(&quot;How to get the number of items?, etc&quot;) | It&#39;s easier to benefit from the rich Python standard library and avoid reinventing the wheel like the random.choice function. | . Note . Just by implementing the __getitem__ special method, the class also becomes iterable.(why?) | . Why len is not a method? . len is not called as a method because it gets special treatment as part of the Python Data Model, just like abs. But thanks to the special method __len__ you can also make len work with your own custom objects | Think of len and abs as unary operators. | . namedtuple &#8212; Tuple Subclass with Named Fields . Each kind of namedtuple is represented by its own class, which is created by using the namedtuple() factory function. . Named tuples assign meaning to each position in a tuple and allow for more readable, self-documenting code. . import collections . Person = collections.namedtuple(&#39;Person&#39;,&#39;name age&#39;) . Returns a new tuple subclass named Person | Any valid Python identifier may be used for a fieldname except for names starting with an underscore. Valid identifiers consist of letters, digits, and underscores but do not start with a digit or underscore and cannot be a keyword such as class, for, return, global, pass, or raise | . Person.__doc__ . &#39;Person(name, age)&#39; . bob = Person(name = &#39;bob&#39;, age = 30) print(&quot;Representation:&quot;, bob) . Representation: Person(name=&#39;bob&#39;, age=30) . it is possible to access the fields of the namedtuple by name using dotted notation (obj.attr) as well as by using the positional indexes of standard tuples. . print(&quot;name: &quot;,bob.name) print(&quot;age: &quot;,bob.age) . name: bob age: 30 . print(&quot;name: &quot;,bob[0]) print(&quot;age: &quot;,bob[1]) . name: bob age: 30 . Just like a regular tuple, a namedtuple is immutable. . bob.name = &quot;Borat&quot; . AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-8-7f4d371f3b6a&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() -&gt; 1 bob.name = &#34;Borat&#34; AttributeError: can&#39;t set attribute . Some special methods defined in namedtuple . bob._fields . (&#39;name&#39;, &#39;age&#39;) . bob._asdict() . OrderedDict([(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;bob&#39;), (&#39;age&#39;, 30)]) . rob = bob._replace(name=&#39;Robert&#39;) . rob is bob # bob and rob are two objects . False . Class method that makes a new instance from an existing sequence or iterable. _make method can be thought of as an alternative constructor . Person._make([&#39;ME&#39;,200]) . Various methods and behaviour of namedtuples . for i in dir(Person): print(i,end=&quot; &quot;) . __add__ __class__ __contains__ __delattr__ __dir__ __doc__ __eq__ __format__ __ge__ __getattribute__ __getitem__ __getnewargs__ __gt__ __hash__ __init__ __init_subclass__ __iter__ __le__ __len__ __lt__ __module__ __mul__ __ne__ __new__ __reduce__ __reduce_ex__ __repr__ __rmul__ __setattr__ __sizeof__ __slots__ __str__ __subclasshook__ _asdict _field_defaults _fields _fields_defaults _make _replace age count index name . Return a random element from a list . import random mylist = [&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;mango&quot;,&quot;banana&quot;] random.choice(mylist) . &#39;mango&#39; . x = &quot;OPEN_SESAME&quot; random.choice(x) . &#39;O&#39; .",
