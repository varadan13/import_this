<h1 id="archive-of-metaphors-and-thoughts-march-2021">Archive of Metaphors and thoughts, March 2021</h1>

<p>I love metaphors and surreal thoughts because I believe they are like mathematics highly capable of telling so many things in a sentence or two. I will maintain this archive as long as I find time to read some of my favourite authors and poets.</p>

<h2 id="from-poems">From Poems</h2>

<p>“Tell me, is the rose naked<br />
or is that her only dress?”</p>

<p>“How many churches are there in heaven?”</p>

<p>“Why do leaves commit suicide<br />
when they feel yellow?”</p>

<p>“How many questions does a cat have?”</p>

<p>“What will they say about my poetry<br />
who never touched my blood?”</p>

<p>“And who asked spring time<br />
for its kingdom of clear air?”</p>

<p>“Why do all silkworms live so raggedly?”</p>

<h2 id="from-prose">From Prose</h2>

<p>“The  designs of the universe are  unknown to  us, but we  do know that to think with lucidity and to  act with fairness is to aid those de­signs  (which shall never be revealed to us).”</p>
